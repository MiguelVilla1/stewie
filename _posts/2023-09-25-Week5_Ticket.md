## This Week's Review
This week, my scrum team and I worked on out team test and we managed to meet all the requirements that were stated in the rubric. We also got to learn about binary and python flask during Mr. Lopez's techtalks.

## Problems/Troubleshooting
In the beginning of the week, our team had a bit of trouble communicating who would do what work and finding times to call outside of school to work on the team test. But, eventually, our team found a way to split the program examples and program development section in a way where we all worked equally. This helped with the team test because it was easier to put everything together when we all knew who did what.
