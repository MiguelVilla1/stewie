## This Week's Review
This week, our team was able to basically to finish all the features on our binary project warmup. I was able to finally start adding color to our project using style tags and have the project have a baby blue color scheme. This week we also started to see our first batch of team teaches on the internet and fault tolerance.

## Problems / Troubleshooting
Some challenges that we ran into was figuring out why our styling wasn't working. But eventually, we figured out that the dark mode theme and the dracula highlights override our blue theme, so we had to comment out the theme. This fixed the error and we were able to add the baby blue theme but it left the rest of the website white with no theme.
