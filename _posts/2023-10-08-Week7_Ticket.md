## This Week's Review
This week our scrum team worked on catching each other up with deploying our websites and making our commits up to date. Our class also had our first team teach on variables and we began doing their homework hacks. Lastly, we deployed our websites to github and updated our commits.

## Problems/Troubleshooting
Some problems that I had was understanding the deployment link when I commited my website. When I clicked on the link, the website would have a blank theme and would not let me access any part of it. But, I realized that I had to give the website time to deploy properly in order for the theme to build in.
