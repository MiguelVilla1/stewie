## This Week's Review
This week, our team presented and assigned homework for our College Board topic, Developing Algorithms. We also had to work on homework hacks for another team teach on Basic Operations. This team teach in particular I liked because the topic was varied and had many operations that could help us with our Passion Project. Lastly, our team began adding data to the backend of our project and added object variable players with their current stats. I also created a cover page with buttons thatlinked to a card opening page.

## Problems and Troubleshooting
Near the end of the week, I experienced some difficulty commiting to my backend repository. I think this might be because I tried adding changes and pulling changes from my team at the same time. I plan to figure this out with  Mr. Lopez next monday. Also, I want to deploy our backend on AWS through another computer because mine seems to not have docker running properly.
