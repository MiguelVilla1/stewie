## This Week's Review
This week was the prep for the night at the museum project presentations. Our tem worked on deploying AWS completely and creating an API to get the player stats from the backend database to the frontend.
## Problems/Troubleshooting
Unfortunately, our team was not able to figure out how to create the API properly which led to problems lter in the week. We were not aware that we needed to have an API model and had to ask Mr. Lopez for help setting it up. Unfortunately, we were not able to make the API work and did not qualify for night at the museum. Currently, we had figured out how to make our entire project run correctly but had just encountered an error that we will try and fix by next week.
