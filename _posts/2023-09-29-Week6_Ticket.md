## Review
This week, our scrum team worked on and finished our JS basics test. We also hadd a techtalk about our future projects like the passion project and AWS deployment.

## Challenges/Troubleshooting
Some problems that we faced was understanding the order that we would put hacks in for the test. But, Mr Lopez was able to point us to the teacher repository and drag the right files we had to work on from there. This made the process easier because it had instructions of what we had to do. Other than that, the problems we had were minor, like checking to see if a cell ran correctly and rewriting code if needed.
