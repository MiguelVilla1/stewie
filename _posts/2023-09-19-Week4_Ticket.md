## This Week's Review
This week, me and my pair worked on modifying our snake game and adding our own changes to showcase in our pair showcase. Some of the changes we added to our snake game was the border width, canvas color, snake speed, and the game over screen (we changed the game over message and added an image). During this week we also established our teams for the team test and began to work on and almost finish our agile methodology page on canvas. Finally, I plan to work on understanding bash script an linux because it was something Mr. Lopez mentioned he'd like to see us make.

## Problems/Troubleshooting
Some problems I faced was getting into Jupyter notebooks through the terminal to access the console on a notebook for one of Mr. Lopez's techtalks. But, I managed to still observe the techtalk because my partner was able to get in (the command that didn't work was "jupyter notebooks -notebook"). I will plan to solve this problem next week with Mr Lopez since this week I was unable to talk to him due to showcases.
