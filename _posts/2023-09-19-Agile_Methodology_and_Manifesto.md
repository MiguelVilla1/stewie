## Agile Manifesto
### 1. Our group's goal is to code and complete a project thoroughly based on the teacher's instructions

### 2. We will adapt to added requirements and rubrics in order to have a specified project for the teacher to see

### 3. Work on projects with group members that will propel learning forwards and complete their corresponding tasks.

### 4. In order to facilitate communication and make sure everyone does their part, groups should talk with each other regarding their project as much as they can during time given in class

### 5. Functioning code and running projects will be an indicator that the group as a whole is succeeding at their tasks

### 6. Skillful and reviewed code will help the project move forward with more success and ease

### 7. Groups will often communicate and establish how they can manage time better and become more profficient within their work and tasks
