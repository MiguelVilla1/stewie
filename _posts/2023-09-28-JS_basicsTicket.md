## Review
This weeks basics test taught me a lot about how to use the console.log and what output to look for in the console. I also learned how to use attributes to add colors, photos, and buttons into my HTML code cells.

# Problems
Some problems I faced was understanding what the purpose of the console.log commands were. But I understood that I had view the console.log commands through console rather than vscode. This showed me the outputs that were made by me which helped with understanding why the code cell didn't show anything when it was ran.
