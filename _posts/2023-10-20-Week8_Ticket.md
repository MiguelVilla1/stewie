## This Week's Review
This week, our scrum team began working on establishing a plan for our Passion Project ideation. We planned to make a game on the show "Who wants to be a millionare?" but after the live review, Mr. Lopez reccomended to maybe change our plan to a game with a backend using databases. Since our initial idea was just involving frontend, we decided to scrap it. This week we also began working and almost finishing our team teach on developing algorithms. We added two popcorn hacks and two homework hacks for the students to do along the way.

## Problems and Troubleshooting
When trying to setup the AWS deployment page on nighthawcodingociety, I kept getting a message about my docker containers not being up to date and kept directing me to a docker page on my browser. I plan to figure this out next week so the Passion Project can be ran properly.
