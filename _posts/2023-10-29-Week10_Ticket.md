## This Week's Review
This week was based on preparing for integration check on Passion Projects and finishing the last batch of team teaches. Our team was able to add the final players that we wanted in our FIFA pack opening game and are beginning to work on connecting the backend to the frontend. We plan to add the final visual touches to our game once we connect front/backend data and hopefully qualify for night at the museum. I also plan to begin and finish my individual final presentation and present it to Mr. Lopez by the end of the week.
## Problems/Troubleshooting
Some of the problems I encountered were once again, deploying AWS due to a problem with docker. I was able to finally update docker and actually start to get through the deployment process. But, there is still a lot steps that I need to complete in order to have our FIFA pack game deployed and running. Other than trouble with following each small step for AWS deployment. Our group needs to figure out how to make an API to get player stats from the backend into the frontend.
