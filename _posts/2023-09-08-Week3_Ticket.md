## This Week's Review
This week, my partner and I worked on our python quizzes and preparing for last week's live review. We were able to get our quizzes running and also added markdown tables next to our HTML tables.

## Problems/Troubleshooting
One of the problems I had was having the markdown tables run properly and not show up as code when I loaded into my website. I figured out that the problem was that my table was supposed to be a IPYNB and was supposed to be put into notebooks.
