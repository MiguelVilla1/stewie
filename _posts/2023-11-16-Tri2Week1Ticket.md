## This Week's Review
This week, we formed new teams and began working on the binary logic warmup project. So far, we have basically completed all the features in hour project including a color wheel, binary lightbulb scale, and a color finder. We plan to complete the SASS styling to make our project blue themed in the following week, complete explanations of the code we completed, and finalize hour project to present when we get back from break.
## Problems/Troubleshooting
Some problems we still have is completely understanding the scss and SASS styling and how to incorporate it into hour project to make the color scheme of it blue.
