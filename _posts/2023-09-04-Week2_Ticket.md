## This Week's Review
This week we worked on implementing actual code into our websites; we added games like snake and began working on programs like Python and HTML which were used to make our tables and quiz.

## Problems/Troubleshooting
I did not fully understand how to set up my "Time Box" and what to write in each part. But, once I did my first live review, my teacher gave clarification and helped clear up uncertanties I had regarding this problem.
