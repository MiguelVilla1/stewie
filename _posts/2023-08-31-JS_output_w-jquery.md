## The Benefits of Having a Markdown Table
Having a Markdown table can be very helpful when organizing information or looking for inforation in an easy to read format. These tables can also help show rankings of many factors; the best soccer teams, the best foods, and the most expensive cars are just some examples of the things a markdown table can organize.
