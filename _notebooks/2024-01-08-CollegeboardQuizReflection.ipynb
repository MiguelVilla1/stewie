    "Q4: In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: A; The program attempted to perform an operation that is considered an undecidable problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: B; The error occurs because there are a fixed number of bits that are used to represent the integers in the program, but the sum tha results from the program is greater than the maximum representable value\n",

    "My Answer: A; Copyright information for the image\n",
