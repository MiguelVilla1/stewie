    "This time that I took the test, I seemed to perform slighty worse than the last time that I took the test. I think this may be because of the time constraint that we were given this time compared to the much larger amount of time we had to take the last mcq. I think that in this test I was able to go at a better pace because we had less time. And I feel like I improved at reading the questions but there is still much room for improvement.\n",
